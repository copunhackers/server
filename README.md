# server
 The connecting to the api's have been removed, as the keys are not valide anymore, which means,
 if you want to use it, you will have to actually find the api's and make reconnect them, 
 by making a new acoount and adding the new keys to the code.
 Meaning you will have to host the server yourself too.
